                Label Nation: prints address labels
                -----------------------------------

This started out as a single PostScript file that printed my name and
address on a sheet of 30 peel-and-stick labels (Maco LL-5805,
compatible with Avery Dennison #5160, which appears to be a
widely-used standard).

As soon as I get done hacking, it will be a generalized label printing
program, with pre-defined configurations for various standards, and
will accept input files of addresses (so you can run a mailing list,
whoo-whee!).

The Plan:
---------

Perl script does all the hard work of converting inputs to PostScript.

A GTK front-end will drive the Perl script, for those who prefer
visual interfaces to command lines.
