                Label Nation: prints address labels
                -----------------------------------

This started out as a single PostScript file that printed my name and
address on a sheet of 30 peel-and-stick labels (Maco LL-5805,
compatible with Avery Dennison #5160, which appears to be a
widely-used standard).

Now it's transmogrified into a generalized labeling program, with
pre-defined configurations for various standards and the option to
define your own standards, and accepts input files of addresses (so
you can run a snail-mailing list, whoo-whee!).

If you read this far, you probably want to know how to use it.  Under
Unix, do this

   prompt$ labelnation.pl --help | more
