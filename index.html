LabelNation is a program for making labels.  By "label", I mean
address labels, business cards, or anything else involving
regularly-arranged rectangles on a printer-ready sheet.  You can even
use it to make a calendar (that took some work, though).

<p>

Here's the basic concept: you tell LabelNation what text you want on
each label (i.e., each rectangle).  You can specify plain lines of
text, or even arbitrary PostScript code.  You also tell it what kind
of labels it should print for.  LabelNation takes all this information
and produces a PostScript file, which you then send to your printer.

<p>

Of course, you'll need a PostScript printer (or a PostScript filter,
such as GNU GhostScript), and a sheet of special peel-off label paper
in the tray.  Such paper is widely available at office supply stores.
Two companies that offer it are <a href="http://www.averydennison.com">
Avery Dennison</a> and <a href="http://www.maco.com">Maco</a>.  This is
not a recommendation nor an endorsement -- Avery and Maco are simply
the names I've seen.

<p>

Label Nation requires Perl, a PostScript printer, and a user who's
comfortable dealing with text- and option-based configuration (as
opposed to a graphical user interface).
