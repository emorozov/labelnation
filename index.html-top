LabelNation is a program for making labels.  By "label", I mean
address labels, business cards, or anything else involving
regularly-arranged rectangles on a printer-ready sheet.  You can even
use it to make a calendar (that took some work, though).

<p>

Here's the basic concept: you tell LabelNation what text you want on
each label.  You can specify plain lines of text, or even arbitrary
PostScript code.  You also tell it what kind of labels it should print
for.  LabelNation takes all this information and produces a PostScript
file, which you then send to your PostScript printer (or through a
filter such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/">GNU
GhostScript</a>).  Of course, there must be a sheet of peel-off labels
in the paper tray.  Such sheets are widely available at office supply
stores.  Two companies that offer it are Avery Dennison and Maco.
This is not a recommendation nor an endorsement; Avery and Maco are
simply the names I've seen.

LabelNation supports standard accented characters (<b>&aacute;</b>,
<b>&agrave;</b>, <b>&oacute;</b>, and so forth, from the ISO 8859-1
standard), and has built-in knowledge of the following standard label
types:
